### Hardware List:
1. 12 (or more) servo motors: $0 (so far)
2. Wood: $0 (so far)
3. Microphone (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1063): $0, provided by Scott
4. Wood glue: $0 (in CEID)
5. Paint: ~$10 (unsure of color, probably going to buy this ourselves at Hull's)

### Piston mechanism:
Quick burst of force…this will hopefully maximize our chances of smooth and synchronized movement
The wood block will only move forward enough to distinguish itself from the rest state, so as to not expose the servo motor + piston

### Concerns:
Need to make sure the movement of each piston (12 total) is as synchronized and smooth as possible



### Block grid:
For now, 12 wooden blocks compose the grid. This might change in the future depending on the clarity of each grid arrangement.
Each wooden block will have some sort of a design on them
Can be the representation of its respective sound wave

### Microphone:
Detecting significant ambient sounds in the surrounding environment.
We will read through the sound waves produced by whatever noise is in the environment, and then attempt to match a particular sound wave to one of the blocks (is this possible?? Need to think about it more)

### Concerns:
Sensitivity will probably require extensive testing
How much noise will the esp32 produce on its own? The Adafruit shop page claims this shouldn’t be an issue if the mic uses the 3.3V pin, but that is just a claim.
